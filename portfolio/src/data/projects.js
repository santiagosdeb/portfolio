        description: "As part of the final project of the 'Soy Henry' web development bootcamp, I helped create a marketplace using a variety of modern technologies and industry-leading tools. Frontend: We implemented HTML, CSS, React and Redux for an interactive marketplace. Backend: Technologies such as NodeJS and Express were used to develop the server logic, allowing efficient management of client requests and responses. Database: MongoDB was used to store and manage the marketplace data, providing a flexible and scalable structure for product, user and transaction management. Outstanding Features: User and profile management: A complete registration, login and user profile system was implemented for a personalized experience. Dynamic Product Catalog: The marketplace offers a large and dynamic catalog that allows users to browse, search and filter products in an intuitive way. Shopping Cart and Payment Process: A functional shopping cart was developed to facilitate product selection and a secure and easy payment process. Collaborative development: I worked closely with a team of my peers using agile methodologies and collaborative development practices such as Git and Scrum agile methodologies. This experience strengthened my teamwork, effective communication, and project management skills. Learning and Challenges: During this project, we faced challenges that allowed us to learn and grow, from integrating multiple technologies to effectively troubleshooting and optimizing website performance.",

        description: "During my time at the Soy Henry Web Development Bootcamp, I was challenged to create my first website as an individual project. This recipe platform was a significant milestone in my learning, focusing on functionality and practical application of key technologies. Technologies used: Frontend: The UI was built using HTML, CSS and React, with Redux used to effectively manage the state of the application. Backend: Solid server logic was developed using NodeJS and Express to handle client requests and responses. Database: Recipe information was efficiently stored and managed in PostgreSQL, allowing recipes to be created, stored and retrieved in a structured manner. Featured Features: External recipe browsing: The platform integrated an external API to browse, search, filter and sort a wide variety of food recipes, providing users with a wide range of options. Personal recipe creation: In addition to the recipes provided by the API, users were able to create and share their own recipes, expanding the diversity and content of the platform. Focus on functionality and usability: For this project, I prioritized functionality and usability over aesthetic design. The main goal was to ensure that all promised features were fully functional and accessible. Learning and challenges: This project was a starting point for my journey as a web developer. I faced the challenges of integrating multiple technologies, learned how to solve problems, and understood the importance of continuous practice to improve my skills. Although the design could be improved, this project allowed me to strengthen my technical skills and understand the importance of creating functional and practical applications as a foundation for future development.",

        description: "In this project, I developed a platform to explore video games coming from an API, focusing on responsive design and using Tailwind CSS to style each component. Technologies used: React and JavaScript: The site was built using React to create a dynamic user interface and JavaScript for the programming logic. Tailwind CSS: I used Tailwind CSS directly on the components to style the page without using their predefined classes. HTML and CSS: These technologies were essential to the overall structure and presentation of the site, working in conjunction with React and Tailwind CSS to achieve a complete user experience. Highlights: Responsive design: I focused on ensuring the platform was accessible and visually appealing on a variety of devices, using responsive design features directly from Tailwind CSS. Video Game Exploration: Users were able to browse, search, and filter a wide selection of video games through the carefully designed interface, providing a smooth and comfortable user experience. Learning and Challenges: This project was an invaluable opportunity to deepen my understanding and practice of designing with Tailwind CSS, allowing me to create a unique and stylized interface without relying on predefined classes. The challenges I faced in the process prompted me to explore and better understand the direct design capabilities of this tool, strengthening my ability to develop projects with robust and adaptive design. This project underscores my commitment to continuous learning and experimentation with new technologies and design approaches, and has contributed significantly to my growth as a web developer.",
